## How to Install and Run the Project

- Fork the repository from this Link: https://github.com/jullianrives7/Galvanize_FEC_Team5

- Copy HTTPS link (save this for later! we will use git clone command with that link)

- Open your terminal and go to the folder you want to clone the Repo into

- type "git clone "https link from the gitub repo"
  ex. "git clone https://github.com/jullianrives7/Galvanize_FEC_Team5.git"

- cd into the file from your terminal, then open the folder in vs code

- once inside the forked repo, make sure to cd into the client folder and type "npm install --force"

- After the dependencies are installed, type "npm run dev" in the terminal to display the website in your browser

## How to Use the Project

The airbnb clone works similar to the items detail page of the orginal website. The components offer user interactions and the page renders them individually. Code for how each component works can be found in the client folder under src, then components.
